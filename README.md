# Machine Learning with Matlab on Coursera
-------
This is the online coursera I took on coursera.


>###Topics of courses include: 

* Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 

* Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 

* Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).









>By understanding mathematical functions of algorithms like neural network, logistic regression, gradient descent, suppport vector machines and their loss function, 
I've learned how to select and optimize ML models using methods like feature selection via PCA, Model parameters tuning as well as cross validation
to avoid the problem of overfiting and underfiting.
